# THE CARE TEAM 
This is an application that is created to assist a team in caring for multiple individuals. The application allows a user to create a customized task list for more than one client. With this person center approach, I am hoping to maximize ifitiancy and communication between those involved in caring for loved ones.


## Built With:
React, Redux, Sagas, JavaScript, Express, CSS, MUI, & PostgreSQL (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).
